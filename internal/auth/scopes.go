// Phase 1.7 — least-privilege scopes for MCP tools (audit
// finding tracked under the 1.7 line in
// docs/security/ZERO-TRUST-TODO.md).
//
// JWT scopes work the way OAuth2 scopes do: a token can
// carry an array of granted scopes (`scopes` claim); the
// receiver checks that the action's required scope is in
// that list before allowing it. They're orthogonal to roles
// — admin role + narrow scopes = "this LLM agent can act
// on my containers but cannot touch secrets" — and the
// least-privilege win is real for the MCP case where an
// agent's JWT effectively grants every tool today.
//
// Backwards compat is preserved by treating a missing or
// nil `scopes` claim as "no scope restriction" — existing
// tokens behave exactly as before. Operators opt in by
// minting tokens with the `--scopes` flag.
//
// Scope strings follow `<resource>:<action>`. The wildcard
// scope `*` matches anything — useful for the daemon's
// long-lived "service" tokens which need full surface
// access. Avoid `*` for tokens handed to agents.

// Scope constants. Keep this list short; new scopes need a
// careful audit (each new scope is a new policy decision).

// HasScope returns true when the granted-scopes set covers

//   - `granted == nil` → no scope restriction. Returns true

//     scopes claim, and they keep working.
//   - `granted == []string{"*"}` (or includes "*") → any
//     scope is allowed.
//   - otherwise → exact membership check.
//
// Empty required scope is interpreted as "no scope needed"
// (some MCP tools are pure-introspection — list_backends,
// get_system_info — and don't gate on a resource); these
// always return true. Use this sparingly; the explicit
// catalog is the supply chain of trust.
