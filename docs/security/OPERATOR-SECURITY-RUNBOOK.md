# Operator Security Runbook

A "what do I do when X" reference for operators running Containarium
in production. Engineering-facing detail lives in
[ZERO-TRUST-AUDIT.md](ZERO-TRUST-AUDIT.md) and
[ZERO-TRUST-TODO.md](ZERO-TRUST-TODO.md); this file is the
operational counterpart — short procedures, the exact commands, and
the rationale in one or two sentences.

If you find yourself doing something here more than once, automate it.
If a procedure here is wrong, update it.

## Token lifecycle

Containarium issues JWTs in three forms (Phase 1.6):

| Form          | `tt` claim   | Default TTL | What it can do                 |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| **access**    | `access`     | 15 min      | Authenticate to the API        |
| **refresh**   | `refresh`    | 30 days     | Exchange at `/v1/tokens/refresh` for a new access + refresh pair |
| **legacy**    | (omitted)    | 24h (CLI default) | Behaves as access on the API surface — kept for backwards compat |

A refresh token **cannot** authenticate to any API surface. Stealing
one only buys the attacker one rotation cycle before the legitimate
holder's next exchange revokes it.

### Mint an operator access token (interactive)

```bash
containarium token generate \
    --username "$YOUR_USERNAME" --roles admin \
    --token-type access --expiry 8h \
    --secret-file /etc/containarium/jwt.secret
```

15-minute defaults are aimed at agents. For an operator session,
`--expiry 8h` is reasonable; the access token cannot be revoked
mid-session except via the kill-switch below.

### Mint a long-lived refresh + short-lived access pair

```bash
# Mint the refresh; store it somewhere only you can read.
containarium token generate \
    --username "$YOUR_USERNAME" --roles admin \
    --token-type refresh --expiry 720h \
    --secret-file /etc/containarium/jwt.secret \
    --raw > ~/.containarium/refresh
chmod 0600 ~/.containarium/refresh

# Whenever you need a fresh access token (e.g. on session start):
containarium token refresh \
    --refresh-token-file ~/.containarium/refresh \
    --server https://containarium.kafeido.app
```

`token refresh` prints the new access token (use for the next ~15
minutes) and a new refresh token (replaces the old one — the prior
file's contents are now revoked server-side).

---

## Suspected credential leak

You believe a JWT, refresh token, or operator credential has been
exposed (pushed to a public gist, leaked via a tenant logfile,
present in a screen recording, …).

### Step 1 — Find the `jti`

Every authenticated request the leaked token made was audit-logged
with its `jti` claim. Pull it from the audit log:

```bash
containarium audit query \
    --username "$LEAKED_USERNAME" \
    --from "2026-05-20T00:00:00Z" \
    --limit 50
```

Each row carries the `jti` in the detail column. If you have the raw
JWT, you can also base64-decode the payload segment:

```bash
echo "$LEAKED_TOKEN" | cut -d. -f2 | base64 -d | jq .
```

### Step 2 — Revoke

```bash
containarium token revoke \
    --jti "$JTI" \
    --reason "leaked_to_public_gist_$(date -u +%Y%m%d)" \
    --server https://containarium.kafeido.app \
    --token "$ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

Idempotent — running it twice with the same `jti` preserves the first
reason. From this point on, any request bearing the revoked token
gets `401 invalid token`.

### Step 3 — If the leaked token was a refresh token

The exchange endpoint won't accept it once revoked, BUT the
attacker may already have exchanged it for a fresh pair before you
caught the leak. To be safe:

1. Revoke every refresh-token jti the user issued in the suspicious
   window (filter audit by `action=token_refresh`).
2. Force the user to re-mint at the daemon (`containarium token
   generate --token-type refresh`).

### Step 4 — Look for lateral movement

```bash
# Anything the leaked user did between issuance and revocation
containarium audit query --username "$LEAKED_USERNAME" --from "$ISSUE_TIME"
```

Triage by action type: container create/delete, secret read,
`expose_port`, `toggle_monitoring` — anything write-shaped is worth
manual review.

## Issuing least-privilege tokens for agents

LLM agents (Claude, Cursor, etc.) consuming the MCP server should
NOT be carrying admin-role unrestricted tokens. The Phase 1.7 scope
model (`internal/auth/scopes.go`) lets you mint narrow tokens:

```bash
# Read-only agent — can list and inspect, can't mutate
containarium token generate \
    --username "agent-claude-readonly" --roles user \
    --scopes containers:read,secrets:read,routes:read \
    --token-type access --expiry 24h \
    --secret-file /etc/containarium/jwt.secret

# Container-ops agent — can lifecycle containers but not touch secrets
containarium token generate \
    --username "agent-claude-ops" --roles user \
    --scopes containers:read,containers:write,routes:read,routes:write,ssh:write \
    --token-type access --expiry 24h \
    --secret-file /etc/containarium/jwt.secret
```

Available scopes (full list in `internal/auth/scopes.go`):

| Scope                | Tools                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `containers:read`    | list/get/debug containers, metrics, system info      |
| `containers:write`   | create/delete/start/stop/resize/move containers      |
| `secrets:read`       | get/list secrets                                     |
| `secrets:write`      | set/delete/refresh secrets                           |
| `routes:read`        | list routes                                          |
| `routes:write`       | expose ports                                         |
| `security:read`      | view findings                                        |
| `security:write`     | trigger scans, remediate                             |
| `alerts:read`        | view alert rules + webhook deliveries                |
| `alerts:write`       | create/update/delete alert rules, webhook config     |
| `traffic:read`       | query traffic history + subscribe to events          |
| `ssh:write`          | add/remove SSH keys, sync ssh-config                 |
| `code:write`         | `push`, `sync` developer-loop tools                  |
| `tokens:write`       | revoke other JWTs                                    |
| `*`                  | wildcard — everything (avoid for agent tokens)       |

The MCP server filters `tools/list` to scopes the JWT grants and
rejects out-of-scope `tools/call` locally before the request hits the
network. The daemon enforces the same gates on REST/gRPC, so a
non-MCP REST caller using a scoped token gets the same restrictions.

---

## Rotating the JWT signing secret

The signing secret lives at `/etc/containarium/jwt.secret` (mode
`0600`). Rotating it invalidates **every** issued token — operators
included — so plan the cutover.

```bash
# 1. Generate a new secret (>=32 bytes for HMAC-SHA256 floor)
openssl rand -base64 48 | sudo tee /etc/containarium/jwt.secret.new
sudo chmod 0600 /etc/containarium/jwt.secret.new
sudo chown root:root /etc/containarium/jwt.secret.new

# 2. Swap atomically
sudo mv /etc/containarium/jwt.secret.new /etc/containarium/jwt.secret

# 3. Restart the daemon (token validation reads on each call but
#    the secret is captured at NewTokenManager time, so a restart
#    is required to pick it up)
sudo systemctl restart containarium

# 4. Re-mint your own admin token immediately (use the new secret)
containarium token generate --username "$YOUR_USERNAME" --roles admin \
    --token-type access --expiry 8h \
    --secret-file /etc/containarium/jwt.secret
```

The audit-log entry for the restart will be missing the daemon's
self-issued system token (which is re-minted on startup against the
new secret); that's expected.

---

## Rotating Postgres credentials

Containarium reads Postgres credentials from (in order):
`CONTAINARIUM_POSTGRES_URL_FILE` → `CONTAINARIUM_POSTGRES_URL` →
auto-detect with password from `CONTAINARIUM_POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE` /
`CONTAINARIUM_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` / compiled-in dev default.

### Recommended deployment shape

```bash
sudo install -m 0600 -o root -g root \
    <(echo -n "$NEW_PG_PASSWORD") \
    /etc/containarium/postgres.password
```

Set in the daemon's systemd unit:

```ini
Environment="CONTAINARIUM_POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/etc/containarium/postgres.password"
```

To rotate, update the file in place and restart the daemon. No code
or config change required:

```bash
echo -n "$NEW_PG_PASSWORD" | sudo tee /etc/containarium/postgres.password > /dev/null
sudo chmod 0600 /etc/containarium/postgres.password
sudo systemctl restart containarium
```

The daemon refuses to start if the file is world-readable — same
contract as the JWT token file (Phase C-HIGH-7).

---

## Locking down `/wake/` to a known load balancer

The wake-on-HTTP handler (Phase 1.9) is reachable on the daemon's
public HTTP port. Without an explicit allowlist, any source can
trigger a container wake by crafting the `Host` header. In production
where Caddy lives on the same host as the daemon, loopback is always
trusted — but operators with off-host Caddy / GLB / sentinel paths
should pin the source:

```bash
# Set in the daemon's systemd Environment=
CONTAINARIUM_WAKE_TRUSTED_PROXIES=10.0.0.0/8,192.168.1.5,fd00::/8
```

The handler rejects any source not in the allowlist with `403 wake:
source not permitted`. Wildcard `/0` prefixes are explicitly refused
at load — defeating the gate would be worse than turning it off.

If `CONTAINARIUM_WAKE_TRUSTED_PROXIES` is unset and Caddy is NOT on
the same host, you'll see the startup `WARNING` log line and every
non-loopback source will be accepted (pre-1.9 behavior). Setting the
env var is the safe default.

---

## Auditing recent administrative actions

Every authenticated request lands in the `audit_logs` table (Phase
4.5) with timestamp, username, action, resource, source IP, and
optional detail. The CLI can query directly:

```bash
# Everything an admin did in the last hour
containarium audit query \
    --username ops --from "$(date -u -d '1 hour ago' --iso-8601=seconds)" \
    --limit 100

# All token revocations this month
containarium audit query \
    --action token_revoke \
    --from "$(date -u -d '1 month ago' --iso-8601=seconds)" \
    --limit 200
```

The detail column carries the `jti`, request payload summary, and any
audit-relevant context. **Tenant secrets values are scrubbed** by the
`internal/audit/redact.go` redactor before write — operators reading
the table never see plaintext credentials.

---

## Verifying the audit-log hash chain

Each row's `row_hash` is a SHA-256 of its content + the previous
row's hash (Phase 4.5). A tampered or inserted row breaks the chain
at that point. The daemon does NOT auto-verify on every read; ops
runs the verifier when forensics are needed:

```bash
# Verify from the chain start
containarium audit verify

# Verify from a specific row ID (faster for large tables)
containarium audit verify --from-id 100000
```

The verifier reports the row ID where the chain breaks, or "intact"
when every row's `row_hash` recomputes to its stored value.

If the chain is broken:

1. Note the `firstBad` ID. Everything before it is trusted; the row
   at `firstBad` and everything after are suspect.
2. Pull recent operator-shell history on the daemon host — only
   someone with database write access to `audit_logs` can break the
   chain, and that's a small list.
3. Restore the table from the most recent verified backup (the
   chain root from the backup is the authoritative "good" state).
