# Changelog

All notable changes to Containarium will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- **Spot VM preemption recovery race condition**: daemon now waits for core containers (PostgreSQL, Caddy) to be healthy before auto-detection and config loading, preventing permanent route loss after VM restart
- **PostgreSQL connection retry**: all connection sites (daemon config, route store, collaborator store) retry up to 5 times with 3-second intervals instead of failing on first "connection refused"
- **Container outbound internet broken by sentinel iptables**: sentinel PREROUTING jump now excludes the container bridge network (`! -s 10.0.3.0/24`), fixing HTTPS from containers being DNAT'd to the spot VM's own IP instead of reaching the internet

### Changed

- **Label-based core container identification**: core containers tagged with `user.containarium.role` labels (`core-postgres`, `core-caddy`) instead of hardcoded name matching; existing containers auto-backfilled on startup
- **Boot priority ordering**: core containers have `boot.autostart.priority` (PostgreSQL=100, Caddy=90) so Incus starts them in correct order after restart
- **Type-safe `incus.Role` type**: introduced typed string for core container roles replacing raw string comparisons
- **Core containers hidden from user listings**: containers with a `user.containarium.role` label excluded from `ListContainers` API

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Sentinel TLS certificate sync** — sentinel syncs real Let's Encrypt certificates from spot VM's Caddy server, serves valid HTTPS during maintenance mode instead of self-signed certs
  - New `/certs` endpoint on daemon gateway exports Caddy certificates as JSON
  - `CertStore` with SNI-based lookup: exact domain → wildcard → self-signed fallback
  - New daemon flag: `--caddy-cert-dir` (default: `/var/lib/caddy/.local/share/caddy`)
  - New sentinel flag: `--cert-sync-interval` (default: `6h`)
  - Immediate cert sync on recovery (MAINTENANCE → PROXY transition)
- **Sentinel status page** — real-time recovery information at `/sentinel` during maintenance mode
  - Shows: current mode, spot VM IP, forwarded ports, preemption count, last preemption, outage duration, cert sync status
  - Dark theme matching maintenance page, auto-refreshes every 10s
- **Sentinel JSON status API** — machine-readable `/status` endpoint on binary server port (8888), always available regardless of mode
- **Management SSH on port 2222** — sentinel listens on port 2222 for direct management access (port 22 is DNAT'd to spot VM in proxy mode)
  - Startup script configures sshd to listen on both port 22 and 2222
  - New Terraform firewall rule: `sentinel_mgmt_ssh` for port 2222
- **`docs/SENTINEL-DESIGN.md`** — comprehensive sentinel architecture documentation covering modes, TLS cert sync, status page, CLI reference, one-sentinel-to-many-spot-VMs scaling, Terraform config, and operational runbook

### Changed
- Updated README.md architecture to reflect one-sentinel-to-many-spot-VMs scaling model
- Updated `SPOT-RECOVERY.md`, `SPOT-INSTANCES-AND-SCALING.md`, `HORIZONTAL-SCALING-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `terraform/gce/README.md` to reference new `SENTINEL-DESIGN.md`
- Sentinel startup script: fixed `systemctl restart sshd` → `ssh || sshd || true` for Ubuntu compatibility

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **Collaborator permission levels** — fine-grained access control when adding collaborators
  - `--sudo` flag grants full sudo access (`ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`) instead of restricted `su - owner`
  - `--container-runtime` flag adds collaborator to docker/podman groups for container runtime access
  - New proto fields: `grant_sudo`, `grant_container_runtime` on `AddCollaboratorRequest`; `has_sudo`, `has_container_runtime` on `Collaborator`
  - PostgreSQL schema migration adds `has_sudo` and `has_container_runtime` columns
  - Web UI: checkboxes in Add Collaborator form, permission badges (sudo/docker chips) in collaborator table
  - CLI: `containarium collaborator add alice bob --ssh-key bob.pub --sudo --container-runtime`
- **Docker CE software stack** — proper Docker installation as a stack option
  - New `docker` stack in `configs/stacks.yaml` with Docker CE apt repository setup
  - Installs `docker-ce`, `docker-ce-cli`, `containerd.io`, `docker-compose-plugin`
  - Automatically adds user to `docker` group when docker stack is selected
  - Web UI: Docker Development option in stack selection dropdown
- **Stack pre-install commands** — `pre_install` field in Stack struct for commands that run as root before `apt-get install` (e.g., adding apt repositories)
- **Daemon config persistence in PostgreSQL** for self-bootstrapping after VM recreation
  - New `daemon_config` key-value table stores: `base_domain`, `http_port`, `grpc_port`, `listen_address`, `enable_mtls`, `enable_rest`, `enable_app_hosting`
  - Auto-detect PostgreSQL container IP from Incus (`containarium-core-postgres`) — no `--postgres` flag needed
  - On startup, loads saved config from DB; CLI flags always override DB values (`cmd.Flags().Changed()`)
  - On successful start, saves current config back to DB for next boot
  - New `DaemonConfigStore` in `internal/app/daemon_config_store.go` with `Get`, `Set`, `GetAll`, `SetAll` methods
  - Systemd service reduced from 6 flags to 2: `--rest --jwt-secret-file /etc/containarium/jwt.secret`
  - JWT secret intentionally kept out of PostgreSQL (remains on filesystem)
- **`containarium service install` command** for single-command systemd service setup
  - Writes the canonical service file with correct `ReadWritePaths` (includes `/var/lock` for useradd flock)
  - Generates JWT secret file if it doesn't exist
  - Enables and starts the service automatically
  - Replaces inline heredocs in `hacks/install.sh`, `terraform/gce/scripts/startup.sh`, and `startup-spot.sh`
  - Also: `containarium service status` and `containarium service uninstall`
- **AppServer graceful degradation** — `/v1/apps` returns empty list instead of 501 when app hosting is disabled
- Collaborator management for containers (add/remove/list collaborators)

### Fixed
- **Route domain doubling in Caddy**: Routes with independent FQDNs (e.g., `api.kafeido.app`) were incorrectly getting the base domain appended (`api.kafeido.app.containarium.kafeido.app`), causing TLS and routing failures. Fixed `ProxyManager.addRouteWithProtocol()` to only append base domain for simple subdomains (no dots), leaving FQDNs as-is.
- **Routes API returning empty when app-hosting disabled**: The `/v1/network/routes` endpoint returned no routes because the standalone route store (created when `--app-hosting` is off) was never assigned to `NetworkServer`. Routes existed in PostgreSQL and synced to Caddy correctly, but the API couldn't serve them.
- **Route sync loop churning every 5 seconds**: The domain doubling bug caused a perpetual add/remove cycle (`+4 added, -4 removed` every tick) because Caddy's doubled domains never matched PostgreSQL's correct domains.
- **Useradd lock file on read-only filesystem**: `flock /var/lock/containarium-useradd.lock` failed with `ProtectSystem=strict` because `/var/lock` was not in `ReadWritePaths`. Now included in the canonical service template.
- Force remove agent when creating user container
- Persist Caddy route records into PostgreSQL as single source of truth
- Startup deadlock

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-15

- Event types for containers: created, deleted, started, stopped, state changed
- Event types for apps: deployed, deleted, started, stopped, state changed
- Event types for routes: added, deleted
- Central event bus (`internal/events/bus.go`) with pub/sub pattern
- Type-safe event emission via `Emitter` interface
- Frontend `useEventStream` hook with automatic reconnection and heartbeat handling

- Displays load as "X.XX / N cores" format for easy interpretation
- Color-coded utilization: green (<60%), yellow (60-80%), red (>80%)
- Backend reads load averages from `/proc/loadavg`
- New proto fields: `cpu_load_1min`, `cpu_load_5min`, `cpu_load_15min` in SystemInfo

#### Disaster Recovery Command
- New `containarium recover` command for restoring containers after instance recreation
- Supports two modes:

    ```bash
    containarium recover \
      --network-cidr 10.0.3.1/24 \
      --zfs-source incus-pool/containers
    ```
  - **Config mode**: Load from persistent storage config file
    ```bash
    containarium recover --config /mnt/incus-data/containarium-recovery.yaml
    ```
- Recovery process handles:
  1. Network creation (incusbr0 with correct CIDR)
  2. Storage pool import via `incus admin recover`
  3. Default profile configuration (eth0 device)
  4. Starting all recovered containers
  5. Syncing SSH jump accounts via `sync-accounts`
- Recovery config is automatically saved to persistent storage during daemon startup
- Supports `--dry-run` flag to preview recovery actions

- View active TCP/UDP connections per container with:
  - Source/destination IP and port
  - Protocol and connection state (ESTABLISHED, TIME_WAIT, etc.)
  - Bytes sent/received with live counters
  - Connection direction (INGRESS/EGRESS)
  - Duration and timeout information
- Connection summary showing aggregate stats:
  - Active connection counts (total, TCP, UDP)

- Routes managed via Caddy Admin API for dynamic configuration
- New API endpoint: `GET /v1/network/dns-records` for domain suggestions

#### gRPC Proxy Support
- Added protocol selection (HTTP/gRPC) when creating proxy routes
- gRPC routes use HTTP/2 (h2c) transport for backend communication
- Caddy reverse proxy automatically configured with correct protocol handling
- New `RouteProtocol` enum in proto: `ROUTE_PROTOCOL_HTTP`, `ROUTE_PROTOCOL_GRPC`
- Protocol field added to `ProxyRoute`, `AddRouteRequest`, `UpdateRouteRequest`
- Web UI shows protocol column in routes table (HTTP/gRPC chip)
- Protocol selector dropdown in Add Route dialog
- Backend support via `NewGRPCTransport()` and `AddGRPCRoute()` in proxy manager

#### TCP/UDP Passthrough Routes
- Added passthrough route support for direct TCP/UDP port forwarding via iptables
- Ideal for mTLS gRPC services where TLS should not be terminated at proxy
- Unified routes view in Web UI showing both proxy and passthrough routes
- Route type selector in Add Route dialog: Proxy (TLS terminated) vs Passthrough (direct)
- New proto definitions: `RouteType` enum, `PassthroughRoute` message
- New `RouteProtocol` values: `ROUTE_PROTOCOL_TCP`, `ROUTE_PROTOCOL_UDP`
- REST API endpoints:
  - `GET /v1/network/passthrough` - List passthrough routes

  - `DELETE /v1/network/passthrough/{external_port}` - Delete passthrough route
- Backend `PassthroughManager` in `internal/network/portforward.go` for iptables management
- Web UI visual distinction: Proxy routes (🌐) vs Passthrough routes (🔌)

#### Automatic TLS Certificate Provisioning
- New `ProvisionTLS()` method in ProxyManager for automatic SSL certificate provisioning
- When adding a route, Caddy automatically obtains a TLS certificate for the domain
- Adds domain to Caddy's TLS automation policy with ACME (Let's Encrypt) and ZeroSSL issuers
- Graceful fallback: if TLS provisioning fails, route is still added (may use wildcard cert)
- See [docs/TLS-PROVISIONING.md](docs/TLS-PROVISIONING.md) for detailed documentation

#### Disaster Recovery Command
- See [docs/DISASTER-RECOVERY.md](docs/DISASTER-RECOVERY.md) for detailed documentation

### Changed

#### Docker to Podman Migration
- **BREAKING**: Replaced Docker with Podman as the container runtime inside LXC containers
- Renamed proto fields: `enable_docker` → `enable_podman`, `docker_enabled` → `podman_enabled`
- Updated CLI flag: `--docker` → `--podman` (default: true)
- Updated Web UI: "Enable Docker" checkbox → "Enable Podman" checkbox
- **Podman 5.x from Kubic repository**: Uses OpenSUSE Kubic unstable repository for latest Podman versions (5.x) instead of Ubuntu's default (4.9.x)
- **podman-compose via pip**: Installs podman-compose from PyPI for latest version instead of apt package
- Podman provides Docker-compatible CLI (`podman` commands work like `docker`)
- Note: Dockerfile naming kept as standard (works with both Docker and Podman)

- Dashboard "CPU Cores" section renamed to "CPU Load" with usage visualization
- Route management moved from Apps tab to Network tab exclusively
- `RemoveRoute` now properly extracts subdomain from full domain for deletion
- Added fallback deletion by route index when routes lack `@id` field
- **Auto-detect Caddy container IP**: When `--app-hosting` is enabled and `--caddy-admin-url` is not specified, the daemon automatically finds a running container with "caddy" in its name and uses its IP for the Caddy Admin API (e.g., `http://10.0.3.111:2019`)
- **Type-safe Caddy API**: Refactored `proxy.go` to use strongly-typed structs instead of `map[string]interface{}` for Caddy API interactions. New types include `CaddyRouteTyped`, `CaddyReverseProxyHandler`, `CaddyTLSAutomationPolicy`, `CaddyTLSIssuer`, and helper functions like `NewTLSPolicy()` and `NewReverseProxyRoute()`

### Fixed
- Fixed route deletion when full domain is passed instead of subdomain
- Fixed routes created via Caddyfile not being deletable (missing @id)
- Fixed WebUI static files not being embedded correctly after build
- **Fixed port forwarding blocking container outbound HTTPS**: iptables PREROUTING rules now exclude the entire container network CIDR (`! -s 10.x.x.0/24`) instead of just Caddy's IP. This allows all containers to access external HTTPS services (Docker Hub, Let's Encrypt, etc.)
- Fixed route display showing `ip:port:0` format by properly parsing Caddy's `Dial` field into separate IP and port fields

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-10

### Security

- **Test fixtures** for upgrade testing without needing real releases

### Fixed
- Docker build support by requiring Incus 6.19+ (fixes CVE-2025-52881 AppArmor bug)
- Terraform startup scripts now install Incus from Zabbly repository
- All Terraform scripts (both Containarium repo and kafeido-infra) updated for Incus 6.19+
- Fixed typo in proto package name: `continariumv1` → `containariumv1`
- **JWT secret handling** - Fixed trailing newline issues when reading JWT secrets from files
- **Gateway mTLS connection** - Fixed HTTP gateway to properly connect to gRPC server with mTLS
- **Installation script (`hacks/install.sh`)** - Multiple critical fixes:
  - Fixed Incus package conflict by adding APT pinning to prioritize Zabbly repository over Ubuntu
  - Added `--batch --yes` flags to GPG commands for non-interactive SSH installation
  - Changed `incus-tools` to `incus-extra` (newer package name in Zabbly repository)
  - Fixed systemd service permissions (`ProtectSystem=false`, `ProtectHome=false`)
  - Added automatic TLS certificate generation step for mTLS
- **Google Guest Agent race condition** - Fixed `/etc/passwd` lock conflicts during user creation
  - Stop google-guest-agent → remove stale locks → create user → restart agent
  - Prevents "cannot lock /etc/passwd; try again later" errors
- **Container creation improvements**:
  - Fixed image format parsing to support both `ubuntu:24.04` and `images:ubuntu/24.04` formats
  - Fixed SSH directory creation (`.ssh` not created before writing `authorized_keys`)
  - Added `--force` flag to delete and recreate existing containers
- **StopContainer API** - Fixed to use proper API field (`Force: true`) instead of string action

### Changed
- Updated documentation with Incus 6.19+ system requirements
- Renamed `upgrade incus` to `upgrade host` for better clarity (includes more than just Incus)
- Upgrade commands now provide detailed progress and status information
- Proto generation now includes grpc-gateway and OpenAPI plugins

### Security
- JWT-based authentication for REST API with configurable token expiry
- Bearer token validation middleware
- CORS support with configurable origins
- Preserved mTLS authentication for gRPC (unchanged)

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-12

### Added
- Container resize command (`containarium resize`) for dynamic resource adjustment
  - Resize CPU, memory, and disk without downtime
  - Advanced CPU options: range allocation and core pinning
- mTLS (mutual TLS) support for daemon API
  - Certificate generation command (`containarium cert generate`)
  - Client certificate authentication
  - Secure remote management
- Comprehensive documentation for resize functionality
- Remote gRPC daemon for container management
- Production deployment examples with Terraform

### Security
- Added mTLS authentication for daemon API
- SSH hardening in jump server configuration
- Fail2ban integration for brute-force protection

### Infrastructure
- Terraform modules for GCE deployment
- Support for spot instances with persistent storage
- ZFS-backed storage for disk quotas
- Hyperdisk support for C4 instance types

## Upgrade Instructions

### Upgrading from 0.1.x to 0.2.0

**Important:** This version requires Incus 6.19 or later for Docker build support.

1. Upgrade Incus on your host:
   ```bash
   # Add Zabbly repository
   curl -fsSL https://pkgs.zabbly.com/key.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/zabbly-incus.gpg
   echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/zabbly-incus.gpg] https://pkgs.zabbly.com/incus/stable noble main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zabbly-incus-stable.list
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install --only-upgrade incus incus-tools incus-client
   ```

2. Upgrade Containarium binary:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/releases/download/0.2.0/containarium-linux-amd64 -o /tmp/containarium
   sudo install -m 755 /tmp/containarium /usr/local/bin/containarium
   sudo systemctl restart containarium  # if running as daemon
   ```

3. Verify versions:
   ```bash
   incus --version     # Should show 6.19 or later
   containarium version
   ```
