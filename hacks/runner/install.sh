#!/bin/bash
# install.sh — provisions a Containarium box as an ephemeral GitHub
# Actions self-hosted runner for one GitHub repo.
#
# Run this INSIDE a Containarium box (e.g. one created via
# `containarium create runner-1`). It installs:
#
#   - actions-runner (GitHub's official binary)
#   - Common CI toolchains: git, build-essential, Go, Node 22, pnpm 9,
#     buf 1.38.0, golangci-lint
#   - A systemd unit that runs the runner in `--ephemeral` mode in a
#     respawn loop: register → run ONE job → exit → restart fresh.
#
# Required env vars (or pass on command line):
#
#   GH_REPO     org/repo for the runner (e.g. FootprintAI/Containarium-cloud)
#   GH_PAT      personal access token with `repo` scope; used to mint
#               short-lived runner-registration tokens at the start of
#               each loop iteration. Pick from
#               ${GH_BASE_URL}/settings/tokens (classic) or App
#               installation tokens.
#   GH_BASE_URL (optional) base URL of the GitHub server. Defaults to
#               https://github.com. Set this to your GHES URL for
#               GitHub Enterprise Server deployments, e.g.
#               https://github.your-company.internal. The API URL is
#               derived from this (api.github.com for github.com,
#               ${GH_BASE_URL}/api/v3 for GHES). See
#               docs/GHES.md inside the air-gapped install bundle.
#   RUNNER_NAME (optional) name for this runner; defaults to the box
#               hostname. Visible in GitHub's Actions → Runners list.
#   RUNNER_LABELS (optional) comma-separated runner labels; defaults
#               to "containarium,ephemeral". Workflows target with
#               `runs-on: [self-hosted, containarium, ephemeral]`.
#
# Usage from outside the box:
#
#   containarium create runner-1
#   ssh runner-1 'curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/footprintai/containarium/main/hacks/runner/install.sh \
#     | sudo GH_REPO=FootprintAI/Containarium-cloud GH_PAT=ghp_xxx bash'
#
# Against GitHub Enterprise Server:
#
#   ssh runner-1 'sudo \
#     GH_REPO=org/repo \
#     GH_PAT=ghp_xxx \
#     GH_BASE_URL=https://github.your-company.internal \
#     ./hacks/runner/install.sh'
#
# After this runs, the runner registers itself within ~30s and starts
# accepting jobs. Verify at
# https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/settings/actions/runners.

# (below): both FootprintAI/containarium-run (its `install-cli.sh | sudo
# bash` step) and a workflow's own dependency-install steps shell out to
# sudo, and a bare ubuntu/24.04 box may not ship it. We deliberately do NOT
# pre-install repo-specific job tools (rsync, yq, ...) here — once the runner
# user has sudo, the *workflow* installs whatever it needs, keeping the
# runner image generic and repo-agnostic. jq stays because the respawn loop
# itself needs it (to parse the registration-token response) before any job.
